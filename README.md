# C++ Containers
This is a slow project, but the goal is to implement some of the standard C++ containers just like in the STL. It will also contain some data structures such as a linked list or whatnot.
## Code Style
I will try as much as possible follow the Google C++ rules [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
## Actions
To verify the implementations, I will add some tests using GoogleTest for C++ in the future, but initially I'll just build for Ubuntu (ubuntu-latest) and Windows (windows-latest).
